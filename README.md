Aplication of Facade pattern project for Implementation of Technical Activity Support Software in Chemistry Laboratories

## How utilize it
For use the program, just browse through the menus;

For run the software, download the archives for sourcy directory in this repository and open the comand line for compile the program:

### In Linux:

```Bash
javac Main.java
java Main #For run
```

### In Windowns:
I dosen't has any idea of how to run it in Windowns systems...

## Final thoughts
**It's a simple exemple for implementation of Facade pattern**, it does not have any technical laboratory applications at this time.
